# Release workflow

This document explains the steps and timings of the release process in `tezos-packaging`.

Releasing process is almost fully automated, with the initial release PR being created
at most 4 hours after a new Octez release. The only steps that require manual intervention

This allows `tezos-packaging` to closely follow Octez releases without large waiting times.

This process can be described by the following diagram:
